## Hi! I'm Ahsan 👋

I’m a Computer Science (Honours) student at the University of Calgary with a deep interest in software development, research, and building meaningful technology.

🌱 I’m currently learning Swift and RealityKit while working on an application that simulates vision impairments using the Apple Vision Pro.
